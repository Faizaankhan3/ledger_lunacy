# README
This is a sample rails project for a small POC task.

The site is hosted on https://mysite-fmb4.onrender.com/

It takes a while to load for the first time when the site hasn't been visited on the free tier of render

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version: 3.0.0
* Node version: 20.11.1

* System dependencies
  - Postgres, the free app I am using to deploy required to setup a postgres db, thus sqlite is not used
  - Yarn

* Database creation
  - rails db:setup
  - Note this project didn't really require a DB setup, but just the place I am hosting the app I needed it.

* Start
 You can run bin/dev to start the server.
